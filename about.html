   Hi, my name is Miguel and I'm a 12th grader at Pasco High School. I like to listen
   to music and play games on my free time. I also like to play sports with my friends, my favorites
   are basketball, soccer and football. My favorite fruit is a Mango, and my favorite color 
   is cyan. My two favorite animals are the <em>Black Panther</em> and the <em>Lioness</em>, the <em>Panther</em> I chose
   because they look cool and are <strong>smart hunters</strong>, and I chose the
   <em>Lioness</em> because they are <strong>strong</strong> and overall beautiful.
