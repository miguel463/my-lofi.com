  Hi, my name is Miguel and I'm a 12th grader at Pasco High School. I like to listen
  to music and play games on my free time. I also like to play sports with my friends my favorites
  are basketball, soccer and football. My favorite food is Bacon-wrapped Hot Dogs, and my favorite color 
  is a light shade of sky blue. My two favorite animals are the <em>Panda</em> and the <em>Lioness</em>, the <em>Panda</em> I chose
  because they look cool and are <strong>endangered</strong>, and I chose the
  <em>Lioness</em> because they are <strong>strong</strong> hunters and overall beautiful.
