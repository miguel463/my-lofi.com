  <div class="intro" title="About Me">
   Hi, my name is Miguel and I'm a 12th grader at Pasco High School. I like to listen
   to music and play games on my free time. I also like to play sports with my friends, my favorites
   are basketball, soccer and football. My favorite fruit is a Mango, and my favorite color 
   is cyan. My two favorite animals are the <em>Black Panther</em> and the <em>Lioness</em>, the <em>Panther</em> I chose
   because they look cool and are <strong>smart hunters</strong>, and I chose the
   <em>Lioness</em> because they are <strong>strong</strong> and overall beautiful.

    My favorite artists include Logic, Paramore, and Brockhampton.

   One of my favorite groups is called "Brockhampton" they have 15 members in total, with 6 main rappers.
   The other 9 work behind the scenes and can make appearances in songs once in awhile. My favorite songs
   off of their latest release "Saturation II" include "Gold", "Sweet", "Swamp", "Tokyo" and "Junky". Off of 
   Saturation I my favorite songs would be "Star", "Face", "Heat", and "Bump".

  <div class="pbackground">
    My favorite members of Brockhampton are Ameer Vann, Matt Champion,Dom McLennon, Joba, Kevin Abstract and
    Merlyn Wood.(pretty much each rapper) Their Lyricism and flow are all unique amongst each other, paired
    with their own voice modified chorus' brings a unique sound to the music and beat produced by the other 
    members behind the scenes.
