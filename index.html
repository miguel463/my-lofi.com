   Hi, my name is Miguel and I'm a 12th grader at Pasco High School. I like to listen
   to music and play games on my free time. I also like to play sports with my friends, my favorites
   are basketball, soccer and football. My favorite fruit is a Mango, and my favorite color 
   is cyan. My two favorite animals are the <em>Panda</em> and the <em>Lioness</em>, the <em>Panda</em> I chose
   because they look cool and are <strong>endangered</strong>, and I chose the
   <em>Lioness</em> because they are <strong>strong</strong> hunters and overall beautiful.

   One of my favorite groups is called "Brockhampton" they have 15 members in total, with about 6 main rappers.
   The other 10 work behind the scenes and can make appearances in songs once in awhile. My favorite songs
   off of their latest release "Saturation II" include "Gold", "Sweet", "Face", "Swamp" and "Tokyo".
