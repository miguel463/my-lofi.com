  <div class="intro" title="About Me">
   Hi, my name is Miguel and I'm a 12th grader at Pasco High School. I like to listen
   to music and play games on my free time. I also like to watch Netflix whenever a new show airs or
   browse through social media. My favorite fruit is a Mango, and my favorite color is Cyan. My two favorite
   animals are the <em>Black Panther</em> and the <em>Lioness</em>, the <em>Panther</em> I chose
   because they look cool and are <strong>smart hunters</strong>, and I chose the
   <em>Lioness</em> because they are <strong>strong</strong> and overall beautiful.

   One of my favorite groups is called "Brockhampton" they have 15 members in total, with 6 main rappers.
   The other 9 work behind the scenes and can make appearances in songs once in awhile. My favorite songs
   off of their latest release "Saturation II" include "Gold", "Sweet", "Swamp", "Tokyo" and "Junky". Off of 
   Saturation I my favorite songs would be "Star", "Face", "Heat", and "Bump".

    My favorite members of Brockhampton are Ameer Vann, Matt Champion,Dom McLennon, Joba, Kevin Abstract and
    Merlyn Wood (pretty much each rapper) and Kevin Doan (because he likes K-Pop alot). Their Lyricism and flow are all unique amongst each other, paired
    with a chorus that highlights the effort of production, brings a unique sound to the music and beat produced by the other 
    members behind the scenes.

    Recently on December 15th, 2017, brockhampton dropped their third studio album "Saturation III".
    Saturation III is also said to be their final studio album, although they did announce another album named
    "Team Effort" on the day that Sat III dropped. Along with "Team Effort" Brockhampton's Kevin Abstract has 
    a plan to make movies, which is seen with a 20+ minute video of a movie entitled Billy Star.
    Focusing back on Saturation III this album delivers incredible production and effort which is clearly
    noted in it's tracklist, this time around however, more members from behind the scenes join the 
    main rappers and are featured on quite a few songs throughout the album.
